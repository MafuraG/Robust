Given a non linear digital control system with known nonlinearities lying in sector k, Popov V.M. proposed the following 
criteria for such systems 

Re[(1 + jqw)W(jw)] + 1/k > 0

This program displays the geometric intepretation of above criteria such that the user can easily judge wheather the given system is stable or 
not.

If the coefficients of the control system's transfer function lie within a given a known range (this is actually the case in real life) then
using Kharitonov's strong theorem the program formulates the 4 criterion necessary for stability. A graphical interpretation is displayedd to the user
of the program.
